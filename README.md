  <h2>Motive</h2>
  <p>My configuration files are designed to be modular and quick to setup and keep in sync on different systems, which works by changing mostly a single file per component.</p>
  <p>These files are also accessed and written to by my themer script, which takes care of the colors on a wallpaper change.</p>

  <p>I normally change components of my setup based on what works best. I prefer stability over the latest features mostly.</p>
